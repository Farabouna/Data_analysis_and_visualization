# 📌 Speed Dating with Tinder

## 📇 Company's Description

[Tinder](https://tinder.com/) is an online dating and geosocial networking application where users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles. Each profile includes photos, a short bio, and a list of interests.

Tinder was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012. As of 2021, Tinder has recorded more than **65 billion matches** worldwide.

## 🚧 Project Overview

The **marketing team** at Tinder is facing a **decline in matches** and wants to understand **what makes people interested in each other**. To investigate, they conducted a **speed dating experiment**, where participants provided Tinder with **detailed personal information** that could be reflected in their dating profiles.

The dataset collected from this experiment records **each speed date**, along with whether the participants agreed to a second date.

## 🎯 Goals

Analyze the dataset to uncover **key factors** influencing **mutual attraction and second-date decisions**, using:

- 📊 **Descriptive statistics**  
- 📈 **Data visualizations**

---

## 🖼️ Scope of This Project

The dataset was gathered from **experimental speed dating events (2002-2004)**. During these events, attendees had a **four-minute first date** with every other participant of the **opposite sex**. After each date, they were asked:

- **Would you like to see this person again?**
- **Rate your date on six attributes:**
  - ✨ **Attractiveness**
  - 🤝 **Sincerity**
  - 🧠 **Intelligence**
  - 🎉 **Fun**
  - 🚀 **Ambition**
  - 💡 **Shared Interests**

Additionally, participants completed **questionnaires** at different stages:
- **Sign-up survey** (before the event)
- **Follow-up survey** (next day)
- **Follow-up 2 survey** (3-4 weeks later)
- **Scorecard** (immediate rating after each date)
